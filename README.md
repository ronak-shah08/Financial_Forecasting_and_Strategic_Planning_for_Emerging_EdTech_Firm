# Financial Planning and Analysis for an EdTech Firm

### Overview
This project focuses on scenario-based forecasting and financial analysis for an EdTech business, providing a comprehensive view of income projections for the next three financial years. By simulating best, normal, and worst-case scenarios, we offer actionable insights to guide strategic decisions and ensure sustainable growth.

### Key Objectives
- Develop an income statement forecast for three scenarios: best, normal, and worst.
- Analyze and estimate costs and revenues based on market trends, student growth, and pricing strategies.
- Utilize scenario-based forecasting to evaluate the financial feasibility and growth potential.
